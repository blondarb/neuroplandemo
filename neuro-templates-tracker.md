## NOTES

- Templates should follow neuro-builder SKILL v2.2 format
- All templates require neuro-checker validation (target 90%+)
- Physician review required before clinical deployment
- Consider grouping similar diagnoses for efficiency (e.g., all Parkinson's templates together)
- LP reference guide available for conditions requiring CSF analysis
- Some conditions may need separate ED vs Outpatient versions
